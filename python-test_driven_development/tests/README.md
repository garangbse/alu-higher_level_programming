## Description

Test Driven Development is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code. This methodology helps ensure that the code meets requirements and works as expected.

## File Descriptions

### Main Files

- **0-add_integer.py**: A function that adds two integers or floats (converting any floats to integers first), with type checking.

- **2-matrix_divided.py**: Divides all elements of a matrix by a number, ensuring the matrix is valid and handling division rules.

- **3-say_my_name.py**: Prints a person's full name in a formatted string, verifying that inputs are proper strings.

- **4-print_square.py**: Prints a square pattern using # characters based on the size parameter provided.

- **5-text_indentation.py**: Formats text by adding two newlines after specific punctuation marks (., ? and :) and removing extra spaces.

### Test Files

- **tests/0-add_integer.txt**: Doctest for the integer addition function, covering normal operation and error cases.

- **tests/2-matrix_divided.txt**: Doctest verifying the matrix division function with various input types and edge cases.

- **tests/3-say_my_name.txt**: Doctest for the name printing function, checking string handling and error conditions.

- **tests/4-print_square.txt**: Doctest that validates the square printing function with different sizes and input types.

- **tests/5-text_indentation.txt**: Doctest for the text formatting function, ensuring proper spacing and line breaks.

- **tests/6-max_integer_test.py**: Unittest module for a function that finds the maximum integer in a list, covering edge cases.
