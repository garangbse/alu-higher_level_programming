# Python - More Classes and Objects

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate advanced object-oriented programming concepts. Each script builds on previous ones to illustrate different aspects of class definition and usage in Python.

## Scripts Description

- **0-rectangle.py**: Defines an empty Rectangle class as a foundation for further development.

- **1-rectangle.py**: Implements a Rectangle class with width and height attributes, including validation for both properties.

- **2-rectangle.py**: Extends the Rectangle class by adding methods to calculate area and perimeter.

- **3-rectangle.py**: Adds string representation for the Rectangle class using the __str__ method to display rectangles using the # character.

- **4-rectangle.py**: Implements the __repr__ method to enable recreation of a Rectangle instance using eval().

- **5-rectangle.py**: Adds a destructor method (__del__) that prints a message when a Rectangle instance is deleted.

- **6-rectangle.py**: Adds a class attribute to track the number of instances and updates it upon creation and deletion.

- **7-rectangle.py**: Implements the ability to customize the symbol used for string representation.

- **8-rectangle.py**: Adds a static method that compares two rectangles and returns the one with the larger area.

- **9-rectangle.py**: Implements a class method that creates a square (a rectangle with equal width and height).

Each script demonstrates progressive enhancement of a class, showcasing proper attribute encapsulation, method implementation, and special method usage in Python.
